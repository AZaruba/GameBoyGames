# GameBoyGames

A series of tests and a work-in-progress action platform game programmed in C using the Game Boy Development Kit.
The libraries and compiler from the GBDK are not included in this repository.
Sprites, tiles, and background maps made using Game Boy tile Designer and Game Boy Map Builder.

All programming and assets are original work by Andrew Zaruba.

## To Play
Any *.gb file in this repository is a Game Boy executable and can be played on an emulator (I recommend BGB!) 
or downloaded onto a flash cartridge and played on any real Game Boy.

The WitchGame folder contains the code for a Work-In-Progress platform game, while the other files
are tests of various functions.
