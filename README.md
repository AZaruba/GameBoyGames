# GameBoyGames

A series of tests and an in-progress action platform game programmed in C using the Game Boy Development Kit. 
Sprites, tiles, and background maps made using Game Boy tile Designer and Game Boy Map Builder.
All programming and assets are original work by Andrew Zaruba.

## To Play
Any *.gb file in this repository is a Game Boy executable and can be played on an emulator (I recommend BGB!) 
or downloaded onto a flash cartridge and played on any real Game Boy.
